## Abstract

This paper analyzes the fundamental differences between traditional human software development and generative AI coding, proposing a process engineering approach to achieve high-quality development in AI coding. We introduce the concept of "process engineering" that goes beyond traditional "prompt engineering," establishing a systematic framework for stepwise refinement from requirements to implementation. In particular, we establish an innovative task management method through category-based management and selective subtask expansion.

As a notable achievement of this research, we conducted empirical experiments with a medium-scale RAG system (approximately 50 files), successfully achieving a 94% task completion rate and building a working prototype system. The experiments identified 15 design-implementation inconsistency issues, leading to the development of process v1.3 that includes quality gate mechanisms and continuous improvement processes to resolve these issues.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Research Background

In recent years, the rapid development of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT, Claude, and GitHub Copilot has drawn attention to the use of generative AI in software development. However, current generative AI utilization primarily depends on "prompt engineering," which has limitations in achieving consistent, high-quality software development.

This research validates the effectiveness of the process engineering approach in AI coding through empirical experiments in actual projects, in addition to constructing a theoretical framework.

### 1.2 Research Objectives

The objectives of this research are as follows:

1. Clarify the essential differences between human coding and generative AI coding
2. Systematically analyze challenges in AI coding
3. Analyze the limitations of traditional waterfall models and their dependency on business models
4. Propose a process engineering approach aimed purely at technical quality
5. Validate the effectiveness of the proposed method through empirical experiments
6. Establish continuous improvement mechanisms based on experimental results
7. Build a practical development process system capable of handling large-scale system development
8. Establish quality assurance methods at the implementation level through staged task management

### 1.3 Research Background and Motivation

This research began from practical experience in the RagProto project conducted in May 2025. Analysis of the factors that enabled the high-quality construction of an 18,367-line RAG system in just 5 days revealed the following key elements of success:

- Comprehensive planning with a detailed task list of 415 lines
- Systematic task management through 68 GitHub Issues
- Document-driven development (creating 6 types of design documents before implementation)
- Phased implementation approach

This successful experience convinced us that AI coding requires a systematic process engineering approach different from traditional methods. This research aims to theorize the practices from RagProto and establish it as a general-purpose development method through verification in larger-scale projects.

### 1.4 Research Significance

This research presents a new development paradigm that eliminates the dependency on business models (process division) inherent in traditional waterfall models and pursues purely technical quality and scalability. Through process engineering that maximizes the characteristics of generative AI, we establish an integrated high-quality development method that does not depend on process division.

**Major Contributions**:
1. **Theoretical Contribution**: Establishment of process engineering theory specialized for AI coding
2. **Empirical Contribution**: Validation of effectiveness through empirical experiments in medium-scale systems
3. **Practical Contribution**: Ensuring design-implementation consistency through quality gate mechanisms

5. **Continuous Improvement**: Establishment of an 8-step process incorporating feedback loops

## 2. Limitations of Traditional Waterfall Models and Business Model Dependency

### 2.1 Essential Problems of Traditional Waterfall

#### 2.1.1 Dependency on Process Division Business Model

Traditional waterfall models are designed based on business models rather than technical necessity:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Requirements Definition] --> B[System Design]
    B --> C[Detailed Design]
    C --> D[Implementation]
    D --> E[Testing]
    
    F[Consulting Company] --> A
    G[System Integrator] --> B
    H[Subcontractor] --> C

    J[Offshore] --> E
    
    K[Process Division] --> F
    K --> G
    K --> H
    K --> I
    K --> J
```

**Characteristics of Process Division**:
- Different organizations/companies handle each process
- Quality management dependent on information transmission between processes
- Primary purpose is clarification of contracts and responsibility scope
- Emphasis on business efficiency over technical optimization

#### 2.1.2 Technical Problems Due to Process Division

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Requirements Document] --> B[Basic Design Document]

    F --> D
    F --> E
    
    G[Organizational Disconnection] --> F
    H[Limited Responsibility] --> F
    I[Cost Optimization] --> F
```

**Technical Problems**:
- **Information Degradation**: Quality degradation due to information transmission between processes
- **Difficulty in Overall Optimization**: Reduced overall quality due to local optimization of each process
- **Disconnected Feedback Loops**: Difficulty in reflecting improvement suggestions from later processes
- **Lack of Technical Consistency**: Inconsistent technical judgments by different organizations

#### 2.1.3 Adverse Effects of Business Model Priority

| Aspect | Business Model Focus | Technical Quality Focus |
|--------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Primary Purpose | Cost reduction/responsibility distribution | Quality improvement/technical optimization |

| Information Management | Document-based handover | Continuous information sharing |
| Quality Management | Process completion inspection | Continuous quality assurance |
| Improvement Approach | Contract/process improvement | Technical/method improvement |
| Optimization Target | Individual process efficiency | Overall system quality |

### 2.2 Technical Quality-Focused Approach of AI Waterfall

#### 2.2.1 Pursuit of Pure Technical Optimization

The proposed AI waterfall aims for pure technical optimization freed from business models:

    G --> F
    
    H[Large-scale Support] --> B
    H --> C

```

**Technical Quality-Focused Features**:
- **Integrated Quality Management**: Consistent quality standards throughout all processes
- **Continuous Optimization**: Accumulation of technical improvements at each stage
- **Information Completeness**: Prevention of information degradation between stages
- **Technical Consistency**: Design based on single technical judgment criteria

### 3.3 Practical Origins of the Theory

#### 3.3.1 Initial Practice in the RagProto Project

The prototype of this theory emerged from practices in the RagProto project (May 2025). The project spontaneously adopted the following characteristic approaches:

**Practice of Document-Driven Development**:
- Creating requirements documents, system design documents, and detailed design documents before implementation
- Detailed task definition with a 415-line TODO list
- Setting clear completion criteria for each task

**Systematic Task Management**:
```
TSK-ENV-*   : Environment setup tasks (8 items)
TSK-DB-*    : Database-related (10 items)
TSK-BE-*    : Backend implementation (15 items)
TSK-AG-*    : Agent implementation (8 items)
TSK-API-*   : API development (12 items)
TSK-FE-*    : Frontend (10 items)
TSK-TEST-*  : Test implementation (12 items)
```

This systematic classification enabled efficient management of 68 tasks in 5 days, achieving an astonishing development speed of 3,673 LOC/day.

#### 3.3.2 From Initial Practice to Theory Sublimation

Analysis of the success factors in RagProto extracted the following theoretical elements:

1. **Stepwise Refinement**: Gradual concretization from requirements → design → implementation
2. **Task Atomicity**: Independent task definition at the file level
3. **Built-in Quality**: Quality checkpoints at each stage
4. **Utilization of Parallelism**: Parallel task execution considering dependencies

These elements became the foundation of the later 7-step process. For detailed practical content, refer to Appendix G.

## 4. Analysis of Challenges in AI Coding

### 4.1 Current Limitations of AI Coding

#### 4.1.1 Limitations of Prompt Engineering

The currently mainstream prompt engineering approach has the following limitations:

1. **Lack of Consistency**: Large output variations due to minor prompt changes
2. **Scalability Issues**: Difficulty managing large-scale projects
3. **Quality Instability**: Difficulty predicting output quality
4. **Difficulty in Knowledge Accumulation**: Inability to inherit learning between projects

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Prompt Creation] --> B[AI Execution]

    E --> A
    D -->|Yes| F[Next Task]
    
    G[Trial and Error] --> A
    H[Experience and Intuition] --> A
```

#### 4.1.2 Problems Due to Lack of Structure

- **Information Fragmentation**: Each task is independent, making overall optimization difficult
- **Lack of Traceability**: Impossible to track from requirements to implementation
- **Low Reusability**: Difficulty utilizing past deliverables
- **Difficulty in Quality Management**: Impossible to apply consistent quality standards

### 4.2 Required Elements for AI Coding

## 5. Proposal of Process Engineering Approach

### 5.1 Concept of Process Engineering

#### 5.1.1 Definition

**Process Engineering** is an approach that engineers and optimizes the software development process itself to maximize the characteristics of generative AI.

While traditional prompt engineering focuses on "how to instruct," process engineering focuses on optimizing the entire development process of "what to generate in what order."

#### 5.1.2 Basic Principles

1. **Stepwise Refinement**: Gradual refinement from abstract requirements to concrete implementation
2. **Information Structuring**: Managing information at each stage in standardized formats
3. **Verifiability**: Setting quality checkpoints at each stage
4. **Traceability**: Information management trackable from requirements to implementation
5. **Componentization and Reuse**: Clarifying class/method dependencies to prevent duplicate implementation
6. **Staged Task Management**: Managing coding targets in stages and executing with standardized subtasks
7. **Quality Gate Integration**: Quality assurance mechanisms during phase transitions
8. **Continuous Improvement**: Process improvement based on feedback

### 5.2 Comparison with Traditional Approaches

| Item | Prompt Engineering | Process Engineering |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Focus | Individual instruction optimization | Overall development process optimization |
| Approach | Improvement through trial and error | Systematic process design |
| Consistency | Unstable depending on prompts | High consistency through structuring |
| Scalability | Difficult to manage at scale | Expandable through systematic management |
| Quality Management | Post-output verification centered | Quality assurance at each stage |
| Reusability | Low | High (structured deliverables) |
| Learning Effect | Depends on individual experience | Organizational learning through process improvement |
| Task Management | Ad hoc | Staged/standardized |

### 7.4 Theorization Process

The following elements were systematized as theory by analyzing the successful experience in RagProto:

#### 7.4.1 Elements Extracted from Practice
1. **Document-Driven Development**: Thorough design document creation before implementation
2. **Staged Task Management**: Systematic utilization of 415-line TODO list and GitHub Issues
3. **Built-in Quality**: Quality checkpoints at each stage
4. **Utilization of Parallelism**: Efficient task execution considering dependencies

#### 7.4.2 Sublimation to Theory
These practical elements were structured as the following theoretical framework:

2. **Stepwise Refinement**: Staged development from abstract to concrete
3. **Quality Gate Mechanism**: Quality assurance between phases
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Incorporation of feedback loops

### 7.5 Empirical Results in Task Management System

#### 7.5.1 Project Execution

As a result of consciously applying the theory, 100 tasks were efficiently completed in 21 days (Figure 7.1).

**Figure 7.1: Task Execution and Period by Phase**
```
Phase 0: Documentation/Planning    [███] 18 tasks (3 days) - Theoretical foundation
Phase 1: Backend                  [████████] 35 tasks (10 days) - Core functionality

2. **Value of Process Engineering**: Structured approach achieves both quality and productivity
3. **Possibility of Continuous Improvement**: Theory improvement achieves quantitative results improvement
4. **Scalability**: Consistent effects confirmed from small to medium scale

#### 7.6.2 Practical Implications

Practical insights gained from experimental results:

1. **Importance of Initial Investment**: Investment in documentation (320 pages) yields significant returns in later processes
2. **Explicit Integration**: Component development and integration should be managed as separate tasks
3. **Implementation of Quality Gates**: Early problem detection through automatable quality checks

- **Team Size**: Primarily individual development (effects in team development unverified)
- **Long-term Effects**: Effects in maintenance phase unconfirmed
- **AI Technology Dependency**: Verification with specific AI models (reproducibility with other models needs confirmation)

### 7.7 Conclusion

Through staged empirical experiments, the effectiveness and developability of the AI process engineering approach were confirmed. After confirming basic validity in the first experiment and improving the theory based on those insights, significant improvements were achieved in all metrics in the second experiment.

Three particularly important discoveries are:

1. **Practicality of the Theory**: Completion of medium-scale system with high quality in 21 days
2. **Continuous Improvability**: Theory improvement through experimental feedback generates quantitative effects
3. **AI Collaboration Optimization**: Structured processes maximize AI capabilities

These results show that AI utilization in software development goes beyond mere tool use and demonstrates true value through process-level transformation.

## 13. Conclusion

This research started from practical success in the RagProto project, constructed AI process engineering theory, and validated it through the Task Management System project.

The experience in RagProto, which built an 18,367-line RAG system in just 5 days, clearly demonstrated the necessary elements for AI coding:
- Thorough advance planning (415-line TODO list)
- Systematic task management (68 GitHub Issues)
- Document-driven development (6 types of design documents)
- Phased implementation approach

As a result of theorizing these and validating them in a larger-scale project, the effectiveness and generality of the theory were confirmed. In particular, by consciously applying processes that emerged spontaneously, we achieved significant improvements in quality and documentation (60% reduction in bug density, 5.3x documentation).

The process engineering method including the staged task management approach proposed in this research opens new possibilities for AI coding and has the potential to fundamentally change the future of software development. Theory born from practice has been refined through empirical experiments, and a solid foundation has been established in both theory and practice through quality gate mechanisms and continuous improvement processes.

We expect this method to further develop through continued research and practice, contributing to digital transformation across society.
